ArrayFire's multiple backends (CUDA, OpenCL and native CPU) make it platform independent and highly portable. A few lines of code in ArrayFire can replace dozens of lines of parallel computing code, saving you valuable time and lowering development costs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm for GPUs. Our key advancement is an improved work scheduler, which is central to the performance of SSSP algorithms. Previous GPU solutions for SSSP use simple work schedulers that can be implemented efficiently on GPUs but that produce low quality schedules. Such solutions yield poor work efficiency and can underutilize the hardware due to a lack of parallelism. Our solution introduces a more sophisticated work scheduler---based on a novel highly parallel approximate priority queue---that produces high quality schedules while being efficiently implementable on GPUs.To evaluate our solution, we use 226 graph inputs from the Lonestar 4.0 benchmark suite and the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, and we find that our solution outperforms the previous state-of-the-art solution by an average of 2.9\texttimes{}, showing that an efficient work scheduling mechanism can be implemented on GPUs without sacrificing schedule quality.While this paper focuses on the SSSP problem, it has broader implications for the use of GPUs, illustrating that seemingly ill-suited data structures, such as priority queues, can be efficiently implemented for GPUs if we use the proper software structure.},

abstract = {In the past decade, Graphics Processing Units have played an important role in the field of high-performance computing and they still advance new fields such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and exascale computing. It is therefore important to understand how to extract performance from these processors, something that is not trivial. This survey discusses various optimization techniques found in 450 articles published in the last 14 years. We analyze the optimizations from different perspectives which shows that the various optimizations are highly interrelated, explaining the need for techniques such as auto-tuning.},

abstract = {GPU architectures have emerged as a viable way of considerably improving performance for appropriate applications. Program fragments (kernels) appropriate for GPU execution can be implemented in CUDA or OpenCL and glued into an application via an API.While there is plenty of evidence of performance improvements using this approach, there are many issues with productivity. Programmers must understand an additional programming model and API to program the accelerator; concurrency and synchronization in this programming model is typically expressed differently from the programming model for the host. On top of this, the languages used to write kernels are very low level and thus prone to the kinds of errors that one does not encounter in higher level languages. Programmers must explicitly deal with moving data back-and-forth between the host and the accelerator. These problems are compounded when the user code must be run across a cluster of accelerated nodes. Now the host programming model must further be extended with constructs to deal with scale-out and remote accelerators. We believe there is a critical need for a single source programming model that can be used to write clean, efficient code for heterogeneous, multi-core and scale-out architectures.The APGAS programming model has been developed for such architectures over the past six years. APGAS is based on four fundamental (and architecture-independent) notions: locality, asynchrony, conditional atomicity and order. X10 is an instantiation of the APGAS programming model on top of a base sequential language with Java-style productivity. Earlier work has shown that X10 can be used to write clean and efficient code for homogeneous multi-cores, SMPs, Cell-accelerated nodes, and clusters of such nodes. In this paper we show how X10 programmers can write code that can be compiled and run on GPUs. GPU programming idioms such as threads, blocks, barriers, constant memory, local registers, shared memory variables, etc. can be directly expressed in X10, and do not require new language extensions. We present the design of an extension of the X10-to-C++ compiler which recognizes such idioms and produces CUDA kernel code. We show several benchmarks written in this style. The performance of these kernels is within 80\% of hand-written CUDA kernels.We believe these results establish X10 as a single-source programming language in which clean, efficient programs can be written for GPU-accelerated clusters.},
